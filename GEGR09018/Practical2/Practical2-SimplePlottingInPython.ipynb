For instance, we may want to process a number of geotiff rasters containing canopy height, for the same location but in different years. If we can write code to process just one of these files, we can devise a for-loop to process as many files as we want -- *without taking the time to write the additional code*.\n",

Thus when `year=2003`, the for-loop will open, and plot, the file `WoL_2003_flow.csv`, and when `year=2005`, the for-loop will open, and plot, the file `WoL_2005_flow.csv`.
